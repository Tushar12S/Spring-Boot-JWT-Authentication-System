# Spring-Boot-JWT-Authentication-System
This project demonstrates how to implement a secure user authentication system using Spring Boot and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The system features essential functionalities like user registration, login, and email verification, all protected through JWT token-based authentication. After a user registers with their email, username, and password, a verification code is sent to their email. Upon successful verification, the user can log in and receive a JWT token for accessing protected resources. The application also integrates with Supabase for database management and uses JavaMailSender for sending verification emails.

The backend of the application is built using Spring Boot, and the user data, including verification status, is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase. The project utilizes Spring Security for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users with valid JWT tokens can access protected resources. Additionally, Spring Data JPA is used to interact with the database, making database operations seamless.

The system allows users to sign up by providing their email, username, and password. Once signed up, a verification email is sent containing a code that the user must confirm in order to complete the registration. After verification, the user can log in and obtain a JWT token, which is then required for accessing any restricted endpoints. For email verification, JavaMailSender is configured to send out the verification codes, and the application uses Postman for testing API endpoints related to user registration, login, and verification.

To get started with the project, you need to set up Supabase as the database provider. Create a PostgreSQL database and configure it to store the necessary user details such as username, email, password, and verification status. After setting up the database, configure the application to connect to Supabase by updating the database credentials in the application.properties file. Additionally, the project requires SMTP configuration for email sending, which can be done using a service like Gmail or any SMTP provider of your choice.

Once the environment is set up, you can build and run the application locally using Maven or Gradle. The project is designed to be straightforward to test using Postman, where you can test the various authentication-related API endpoints such as registration, login, and email verification. JWT tokens are generated upon successful login and are required for accessing any protected routes in the application.

This project serves as a foundation for building a secure authentication system using JWT in Spring Boot. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as user roles, password reset functionality, and multi-factor authentication to increase security. Additionally, integrating third-party authentication via OAuth2 is also a possible enhancement for future versions.
